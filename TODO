* TODO Default profiles.ini
Default location of ~profiles.ini~ varies by operating system.
- Unix/Linux: ~/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini
- MacOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/profiles.ini

* TODO Look up profile directory
There's a [[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/ini_lookup.html][lookup plugin for .ini files]]. Should be possible to use that to read the ~profiles.ini~ file and get the actual directory used for a given profile, and not guess it.

Profiles are of the form:
#+begin_src conf
[Profile6]
Name=NCBI4
IsRelative=1
Path=ccb0rcrm.NCBI4
#+end_src

So to look up a profile by name (here, "NCBI4"), need to find the section that contains "Name=NCBI4". If that's not possible, might need to iterate over all sections.

Doesn't look as though there's a way to do this kind of search. However, the sections are of the form "Profile<n>". And apparently Firefox keeps removes gaps, so that if there are N profiles, they will be =Profile0= through =ProfileN=. So in principle, we can set up a for loop:

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/playbooks_loops.html#looping-over-integer-sequences

Search =Profile0=, =Profile1=, ... =ProfileN= until the desired section doesn't exist.

* Addons
It might not be possible to install addons just by dumping an xpi file in a directory somewhere. It might be necessary to create a =policies.json= file that says to download and update certain extensions.

Or maybe it /is/ possible:
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/deploying-firefox-with-extensions
says to dump the XPI files in a directory.

So maybe it's just that unknown or unsigned extensions won't be allowed, which doesn't concern us.

See
https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/distribute-sideloading/#standard-extension-folders

* Themes
They're documented in =extensions.json=. Apparently they're considered addons just like plugins.

=green-abstract= is in
: ~/.mozilla/firefox/gbg4mnfw.carrot/extensions/{ce743293-2169-47f3-bccf-dc42e2121e0a}.xpi

* TODO Delete profiles
It would be nice to delete profiles as well as create them:
: firefox -no-remote -DeleteProfile <profile>

But on MacOS, this fails when Firefox is already running.

* TODO Fill out README.md

* TODO Upload to ansible-galaxy

* TODO Support for snap version
Make this an option: while installing Firefox as a snap is the default, it's not required.

Maybe run
: snap info firefox
and see if it returns 0
