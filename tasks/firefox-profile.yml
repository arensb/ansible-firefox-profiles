#     - "{{ profile }}"
#   register: profile_status
#   when:
#     - profile_state == "absent"
#
# The manual way to do this would be to tweak the profiles.ini file:
# delete (or comment out) the entire stanza with the profile, and
# recursively delete its directory.
#
# - If deleting the default profile, pick a different one to be the default.
#   - If there are no other profiles, throw an error.
#   - Set "Default=1" on some other profile. Maybe the first one that isn't
#     the current one.
#   - Set "Default=<new default profile id>" on [InstallNNN], if it exists.
#     - Also make this change in installs.ini: that's a backup of the
#       Install section:
#       https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/understanding-depth-profile-installation
# - Get the profile directory.
# - Delete the stanza
# - If desired, delete the profile directory.

# XXX - It would be nice to do this some way other than grep, for
# portability to non-Unix OSes (*cough*Windows*cough*), but I don't
# know of one.

# XXX - profile.ini has a set of sections named Profile0, Profile1, etc.
# Iterate over these with a for-loop. In each one, Look up "Name".
#   If Name equals {{ profile }}, save to register profile.
# Finally, if profile register is unset, the profile doesn't exist.
